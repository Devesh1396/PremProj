# CLAUDE.md

Read this first, every session. It is the operating contract for this repo.

## What this is

An internal AI-assisted nutrition and functional-health operating system
for **one** Certified Functional Nutritionist. Seven specialist reasoning
engines, a longitudinal client record, and a continuously growing knowledge
library, orchestrated by n8n over PostgreSQL.

It is **not** a diet-plan generator, not a consumer chatbot, and not
multi-tenant SaaS.

The practitioner remains the professional decision-maker. The software
removes **repetitive cognitive labour**, not professional judgment.

You are the builder. You are not part of the runtime. When this is
finished it must keep working on n8n + PostgreSQL + an LLM API alone.

## Read these before you build

| File | When |
|---|---|
| `docs/DECISIONS.md` | **Before proposing any structural change.** 15 settled decisions with rationale and rejected alternatives. |
| `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md` | The 40-phase build specification plus amendments. |
| `BUILD_PLAN.md` | Milestones, dependencies, acceptance criteria. |
| `PROGRESS.md` | What actually works, tests passed, bugs fixed, next exact task. |
| `docs/OPERATIONS.md` | VPS deployment, roles, backup, restore. |
| `prompts/*.md` | The seven engine specifications. Authoritative domain logic. |

Several constraints in this repo look like overhead if you don't know what
they protect against. `DECISIONS.md` explains each one. **If a decision
genuinely blocks implementation, raise it as a blocker. Do not route around
it.**

## The seven engines

| | Role |
|---|---|
| E1 | Decide what matters clinically and nutritionally |
| E2 | Make behaviour executable |
| E3 | Make nutrition executable |
| E4 | Learn from response |
| E5 | Communicate to the client |
| E6 | Remember the complete evolving case |
| E7 | Know far more interventions and evidence than the practitioner could personally read |

They are **specialist skills of one agent**, not seven chatbots.

Primary path:
```
E6 → E1 Pass A → normalization → E7 → E1 Pass B → E2 → E3
   → E6 update → practitioner review → E5 → follow-up/E4
```

## Hard rules

### 1. Engine prompts are authoritative
Never shorten, summarise, rewrite or "optimise" a file in `prompts/`.
They are master reasoning specifications. Technical formatting fixes only.

**Prompt length is not output length.** A 5,000-word specification
describes how an engine reasons; it is not a template for a 50-page report.
Do not simplify reasoning to make output tidy. Output design is a separate,
later task.

### 2. E1 runs twice with ONE specification
Pass A and Pass B both load `prompts/engine1_prevention.md`. There is no
`engine1_pass_a.md`. Neither pass may be a trimmed or simplified Engine 1.
The difference is context and stopping point, not capability.

Both runs record the **identical prompt hash**. `trg_enforce_two_pass`
rejects a mismatch at insert. That rejection is a build error, not a
variation to work around.

### 3. Automate first
```
AUTOMATE → AUTO-RESOLVE HIGH CONFIDENCE → LOG LOW-IMPACT UNCERTAINTY
         → ESCALATE ONLY HIGH-IMPACT AMBIGUITY
```
**No milestone may create a recurring manual job for the practitioner.**
Their time is the scarce resource. That is the premise of the whole system.

Escalation ranks by **impact, not uncertainty**, and is capped.

### 4. Confidence is not authorization
For ontology aliases, high similarity may auto-resolve.
For **client facts, it may not.** High extraction confidence means the
model heard correctly, not that the fact is true or that anyone authorised
recording it. Chat-derived facts need practitioner approval, an explicit
"save this" instruction, or trusted structured ingestion.

### 5. n8n never parses prose to route
Routing reads typed fields from
`schemas/orchestration/control_contract.v1.json`. Roughly 17 strict fields.
The remaining handoff content stays prose for now, by decision.

### 6. Practice experience is never evidence
`practice_strategy_outcomes` has no foreign key to `evidence_records` and
no view joins them. Do not add one. De-identified aggregates only, minimum
cohort 5.

### 7. Provenance is enforced, not requested
A strategy past `AI_DISCOVERED_CANDIDATE` cannot exist without a provenance
note. `RUN_ENGINE` raises `PromptMissing` rather than falling back to a
stub. An output that cannot be traced to a specification is worse than no
output.

### 8. Client isolation is structural
n8n connects as `phi_runtime` — `NOSUPERUSER`, `NOBYPASSRLS`. Never as
`phi_admin`. Client scope is transaction-local. With no scope set,
client-scoped tables return **zero rows**, not all rows.

### 9. Safety gates release, not analysis
Internal analysis, drafting and the practitioner view are **never** gated.
Only delivery of client-facing output is. NOTE flags never block. The gate
must not fire on ordinary medicated metabolic clients — a gate that fires
constantly is a rubber stamp.

No engine ever instructs a client to stop, reduce or change a prescribed
medication. It may flag that prescriber reassessment is warranted.

### 10. Migrations are append-only
Never edit an applied migration. `scripts/migrate.py` rejects it by
checksum. Add a new one.

`norm_phrase()` backs STORED generated columns; changing it requires a
migration that also rewrites those columns and rebuilds their indexes.

## Working method

```
EXPLORE → PLAN → IMPLEMENT → TEST → FIX → DOCUMENT
```

- Run `bash testing/run_all.sh` before every commit. All suites must pass.
- Commit after each working milestone. Update `PROGRESS.md` with what
  genuinely works, tests passed, bugs fixed, and the next exact task.
- **Never declare completion because files exist.** Verify execution.
- Tests assert behaviour, not table existence. A test that only checks a
  table exists is not a test.
- Tests must be idempotent — clear their own fixtures and re-run cleanly
  against a used database.
- Where something is ambiguous but a reasonable default exists, choose the
  simplest low-cost internal implementation and document the assumption
  rather than stopping.

## Environment

Hostinger VPS, India. 2 vCPU, 8 GB RAM, 100 GB disk.
n8n already running in Docker; this repo adds PostgreSQL to the same
network with **no published port**.

**2 vCPU is the binding constraint.** Most work is API-wait, not compute,
so this matters for concurrency: keep `KNOWLEDGE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` at 2–3.

Never hard-code a model name. Use the five roles: `MODEL_ANALYSIS`,
`MODEL_EXTRACTION`, `MODEL_RESEARCH`, `MODEL_EMBEDDING`, `MODEL_FAST`.

Database is in India; model inference is not. Engine payloads carry
`client_id` and clinical facts, **not names**
(`STRIP_IDENTITY_FROM_ENGINE_PAYLOADS=true`).

---

## State as of this writing

**Complete and verified** — M0 foundations, M1 schema (5 migrations),
M2 engine execution layer.

61 tables, 12 views, 42 enums, 156 indexes, 32 check constraints,
15 triggers, 26 RLS tables, 52 policies. Five test suites, all passing
from an empty database, idempotent, verified on a build with **no pg_trgm
and no btree_gin**.

Working end to end with the fixture provider:
```
E6 init → case v1 → E1 Pass A → research questions
        → E7 → E1 Pass B → both passes, one prompt hash
```

**Blocked pending input:** the seven canonical prompt files, and
`LLM_API_KEY`. Everything around both is built and tested.

**Next:** C3 normalization layer (case track) and K1 ontology seed
(knowledge track), in parallel. See `BUILD_PLAN.md`.

## Do NOT build

Chat UI. Chat intent router. RHT scoring engine. WhatsApp integration.
General-chat interface. Learning dashboards. Client portal. Mobile app.
Billing. Multi-tenant anything.

Schema hooks for chat, assessments and case events exist in migration 005
**so these can be added later without a rewrite**. That is not permission
to build them now.

---

## Deferred by decision, not forgotten

Full engine-output JSON schemas beyond the control contract. Client report
formatting, WhatsApp output, practitioner deep view. Engine 1 call-size
measurement (pending real prompt and API key — measure, do not pre-empt).

## Genuinely open

Intake form V1 (largest unstarted piece, gates the case track).
Practitioner review UI. Deterministic flag rule set (start narrow).
Indian food composition data source. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` OPEN section.
